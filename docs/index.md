# Gluttony Cluster

Welcome to the documentation for my k3s cluster, aka my datacenter at home.

## About this project

This project is a small datacenter that I run in my house. 
The objective is to host service for myself (as oppsed to purchasing SaaS products)
and to provide an environment for my own services I write for myself to be deployed.
I've also learned alot about industry tooling, and DevOps in general from this project.

## Physical Rack

The physical rack is [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YYMSFP1) 20U open rack.
The pack came with two shelves for misc smaller equipment.
