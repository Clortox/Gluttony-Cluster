# Registering a Mail Account

E-Mail accounts are offered via [mail.clortox.com](mail.clortox.com).
Currently due to spam, self registering is not an option. Therefore please reach out
directly if you would like an email account. All email accounts end with `@clortox.com`.

## Checking your mail

### Web Client

Login with your account credentials into [sogo](http://mail.clortox.com/SOGo/) to view
your mail.

### Email Client

Using a dedicated email client (I recomend 
[thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) on PC and
[K-9](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) on android) use the following details to login.

#### IMAP

| Key | Value |
| -- | -- |
| Server Name/Address | mail.clortox.com |
| Port | 993 |
| Security | SSL/TLS |
